    <p><strong>DESCRIPTION: </strong>Gulab jamun is an Indian dessert of fried dough balls that are <br>soaked in a sweet, sticky sugar syrup. As per tradition, the syrup has a delicate rose <br>flavour. Gulab means 'rose water' and jamun refers to a berry of a similar size and colour.</p>
    <p><strong>ORIGIN: </strong>Gulab Jamun emerged in medieval India during the Islamic period, blending Persianate <br>influence with local influences that eventually became gulab jamun. The word "gulab" is derived <br> from the Persian words gul (flower) and ƒÅb (water), referring to the rose water-scented syrup, and <br>"Jamun" or "jaman" is the Hindi word for Syzygium jambolanum, an Indian fruit with a similar size<br> and shape, commonly known as black plum.</p>
